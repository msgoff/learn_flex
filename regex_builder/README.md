make base  
the purpose is to assist in building regular expressions with fewer errors by printing the Run Length Encoding for each line.

for example  
{LOWER}{4}{WS}{LOWER}{4}{WS}{2}{NL}  
make base  

is generated by running ./mmap_flex.out README.MD
using more precise syntax in regular expressions leads to fewer errors and faster runtimes.
